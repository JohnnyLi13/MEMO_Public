# MEMO_Public
Software that keeps track of daily tasks and helps save time on transportation between each task. Please contact for access.

MEMO is a smart To Do List app. Users will write down their tasks in this app. They can specify the location, priority, and deadline of each task. When the user tries to drive from one place to another, MEMO will search the optimized route and check if any of the tasks can be done at a location along the route. If YES, MEMO will inform the user about this possibility and the information of the detour (extra distance & time). Generally, this app is designed to remind its users about their upcoming tasks and save their time in doing these tasks.
